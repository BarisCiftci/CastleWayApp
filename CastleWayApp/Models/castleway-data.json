  "description": "A historic 19th century residence of the historic Górków and Działyński families. The origins of the castle, however, date back to the 14th century. The present shape of the castle refers to the English Gothic Revival. The main entrance to the castle is on the north side. A distinctive feature is the crowning of the main window above the entrance with a Tudor arch. Until the interwar period, the castle was entered through the so-called \"women's gallery\", a barbican-shaped vestibule, demolished in 1925–1939. The west side is an architecturally extensive terrace overlooking the Kórnickie Lake and \"Zwierzyniec\". The southern side is dominated by the Indian arch , probably modeled on the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, and indirectly on the Muslim architecture of India (the arch in Kórnik bears a clear resemblance to the Taj Mahal arches). On the eastern side, a neo-Gothic tower rises above the castle, with its red brick façade contrasting with the rest of the castle, built only during the reconstruction of the castle by Tytus Działyński. Today, the castle houses a museum. ##photo: gminakornik.pl"

  "description": "The building was built on the foundations of a medieval royal castle. The starost's castle was probably built in the time of Casimir the Great in its present place. It consisted of a defensive circuit with a gatehouse, main tower and a castle house, three-storey on a rectangular plan of 23 x 12 m. Władysław Jagiełło extended the Brest castle by two long, one-storey residential and farm houses. Later it was rebuilt in the Renaissance style. Burned by the Swedes before 1664, it fell into ruin, dismantled by the Prussians. In the basement and ground floor of the present building, the remains of a medieval building have probably been preserved, and the remains of walls in the outbuilding. ##photo: brzesckujawski.pl"
